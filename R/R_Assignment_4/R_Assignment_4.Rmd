## Section 5

Huntington subjects to:

- **Credit risk**, which is the risk of loss due to loan and lease customers or other counterparties not being able to meet their financial obligations under agreed upon terms;
- **Market risk**, which occurs when fluctuations in interest rates impact earnings and capital. Financial impacts are realized through changes in the interest rates of balance sheet assets and liabilities (net interest margin) or directly through valuation changes of capitalized MSR and/or trading assets (noninterest income);
- **Liquidity risk**, which is the risk to current or anticipated earnings or capital arising from an inability to meet obligations when they come due. Liquidity risk includes the inability to access funding sources or manage fluctuations in funding levels. Liquidity risk also results from the failure to recognize or address changes in market conditions that affect the Bankâ€™s ability to liquidate assets quickly and with minimal loss in value;
- **Operational and legal risk**, which is the risk of loss arising from inadequate or failed internal processes or systems, human errors or misconduct, or adverse external events. Operational losses result from internal fraud; external fraud, inadequate or inappropriate employment practices and workplace safety, failure to meet professional obligations involving customers, products, and business practices, damage to physical assets, business disruption and systems failures, and failures in execution, delivery, and process management.  Legal risk includes, but is not limited to, exposure to orders, fines, penalties, or punitive damages resulting from litigation, as well as regulatory actions; and
- **Compliance risk**, which exposes us to money penalties, enforcement actions or other sanctions as a result of nonconformance with laws, rules, and regulations that apply to the financial services industry.


### Credit Risk
- The company identifies its credit risk exposures by saying that its ACL level may prove to be inappropriate or be negatively affected which is a main source of net income.
- The economic condition is crucial in its credits

### Market Risk
- Because the company's assets are mainly formed by loans and interest rates contracts, typically personal loans, commercial loans and real estate loans, it subjects to market risks because its assets, liability will be directly affected by interest rate.

### Liquidity Risk
- Its deposits has 80% goes to loans, if its condition is largely affected by the market, it will subject to large liquidity risk cause depositors will lose confidence.

### Operational and Legal Risks:
- They face security risks, including denial of service attacks, hacking, social engineering attacks targeting our colleagues and customers, malware intrusion or data corruption attempts, and identity theft that could result in the disclosure of confidential information, adversely affect our business or reputation, and create significant legal and financial exposure.
- The resolution of significant pending litigation, if unfavorable, could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for a particular period.
- Failure to maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in the future could impair their ability to accurately and timely report our financial results or prevent fraud, resulting in loss of investor confidence and adversely affecting our business and our stock price.
- Its business infrastructure is mainly formed by loans
- Changes in accounting policies, standards, and interpretations could materially affect how we report its financial condition and results of operations.

### Compliance Risks
- Bank regulations regarding capital and liquidity, including the annual CCAR assessment process and the Basel III capital and liquidity standards, could require higher levels of capital and liquidity. Among other things, these regulations could impact our ability to pay common stock dividends, repurchase common stock, attract cost-effective sources of deposits, or require the retention of higher amounts of low yielding securities.
- If regulators deem it appropriate, they can take regulatory actions that could result in a material adverse impact on our financial results, ability to compete for new business, or preclude mergers or acquisitions. In addition, regulatory actions could constrain our ability to fund our liquidity needs or pay dividends. Any of these actions could increase the cost of our services.
- Legislative and regulatory actions taken now or in the future that impact the financial industry may materially adversely affect us by increasing our costs, adding complexity in doing business, impeding the efficiency of our internal business processes, negatively impacting the recoverability of certain of our recorded assets, requiring us to increase our regulatory capital, limiting our ability to pursue business opportunities, and otherwise resulting in a material adverse impact on our financial condition, results of operation, liquidity, or stock price

## Section 6

### Off-Balance Sheet 

- Effective January 1, 2010, Huntington consolidated an automobile loan securitization that previously had been accounted for as an off-balance sheet transaction. As a result, Huntington elected to account for these automobile loan receivables at fair value per guidance supplied in ASC 825. The automobile loan receivables are classified as Level 3

- Like other financial instruments, derivatives contain an element of credit risk, which is the possibility that Huntington will incur a loss because the counterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations. Notional values of interest rate swaps and other off-balance sheet financial instruments significantly exceed the credit risk associated with these instruments and represent contractual balances on which calculations of amounts to be exchanged are based.

- Balance sheet hedging activity is arranged to receive hedge accounting treatment and is classified as either fair value or cash flow hedges. Fair value hedges are purchased to convert deposits and long-term debt from fixed-rate obligations to floating rate. Cash flow hedges are also used to convert floating rate loans made to customers into fixed rate loans. 

### Derivative Uasge

- Huntington uses derivatives, principally loan sale commitments, in hedging its mortgage loan interest rate lock commitments and its mortgage loans held for sale. Mortgage loan sale commitments and the related interest rate lock commitments are carried at fair value on the Consolidated Balance Sheets with changes in fair value reflected in mortgage banking income. 
- Huntington also uses certain derivative financial instruments to offset changes in value of its MSRs. These derivatives consist primarily of forward interest rate agreements and forward mortgage contracts. The derivative instruments used are not designated as qualifying hedges. Accordingly, such derivatives are recorded at fair value with changes in fair value reflected in mortgage banking income.


### Securitization Activities

The UPB of automobile loans totaling \$750 million were transferred to a trust in a securitization transaction in exchange for \$780 million of net proceeds. The securitization and resulting sale of all underlying securities qualified for sale accounting. As a result of this transaction, Huntington recognized a \$5 million gain which is reflected in gain on sale of loans on the Consolidated Statements of Income and recorded an \$11 million servicing asset which is reflected in accrued income and other assets on the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

### Level 1, 2, 3 assets
